# Group 3 Final Project

## Introduction

This project aims to employ computer vision techniques to classify images that contain birds. To be more precise, we would like to count the number of birds present in various images taken in the Amazon Rainforest, specifically focusing on the challenging task of being able to identify birds in the rainforest environment where they are often camouflaged or hidden. By leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning techniques, we would like to enable automated bird identification, which can have various applications in ecological studies, conservation efforts, and wildlife monitoring. The majority of studies conducted in this area utilize Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are especially useful for finding patterns in images to recognize objects, classes, and categories.
